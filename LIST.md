## Disqualified
* Malbolge is intentionally a pain to work with
* LeGit is annoying when you want to work with numbers, because only hardcoded numbers are stored as numbers, the rest is treated as ascii
* Chef looks cool, but not being able to do any of these makes things near impossible:
* * `<` or `>` or `<=` or `>=` in any form other than testing all numbers for equality
* * rounding results of integer divisions
