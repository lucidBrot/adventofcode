# spaces are a lie
# all arguments are integers
# outPos is a position that is modified

### Opcodes

two decimal digits.

| opcode | instruction | signature                                 |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 01     | add         | a1, a2 -> a3                              |
| 02     | multiply    | a1, a2 -> a3                              |
| 03     | save intput | _ -> a1                                   |
| 04     | output      | a1 -> _                                   |
| 05     | jnz         | conditional, target-pc -> _               |
| 06     | jz          | conditional, target-pc -> _               |
| 07     | less than   | smaller, larger -> 1 if true else 0 in a3 |
| 08     | equals      | a1, a2 -> 1 if true else 0 in a3          |
| 99     | exit        | _ -> _                                    |

### Parammodes

| code | mode                                      |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0    | argument is a pointer to a position       |
| 1    | argument is an immediate signed int value |

Leading zeros can be skipped. So read it right-to-left.

Rightmost digit of parmmode is mode of first argument.

Parameters that an instruction writes to will *never be in immediate mode*.

### Pitfalls

Normally, after an instruction is finished, the instruction pointer increases by the number of values in that instruction. *However*, if the instruction modifies the instruction pointer, that value is used and the instruction pointer is *not automatically increased*.
