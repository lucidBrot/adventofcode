/* -*- mode: Xe; file: fizzbuzz.Xe -*-
 * 
 * Toward the destruction of the techbro kyriarchy: a feminist
 * reclamation of "Fizz Buzz"
 *
 * @language: Xe 0.1-pre-alpha
 * https://bitbucket.org/FeministSoftwareFoundation/c-plus-equality
 *
 * notes of interest:
 * 
 * - C+= considered phallic; replaced with (and pronounced) "Xe",
 *    source files have extension ".Xe"
 *
 * - header files are known as headHer files, with extension .Xir
 *
 * - masculinist/dualist concept of "booleanism" removed entirely; use
 *    present() (see below; this also supersedes the officious
 *    "return" with its overtones of mansplaination)
 *
 * - presenting '0' for successful completion lacks positive
 *   confidence in feminist progress; present 1 instead, however xe
 *   pleases (even if xe pleases to present as 0)
 *
 * - for() unduly privileges loop counter variable, replaced by
 *   among()
 *
 * - assignment constrains its lefthand side to an externally imposed
 *   presentation and orientation; replaced by accepts(), and lefthand
 *   side is free to refuse (NO MEANS NO!)
 *
 * - not-greater-than test imposes hierarchy upon free and equal
 *   co-agents, replaced by much more respectful honors()
 *
 * - pre- and post-increment enforce outmoded gender roles upon
 *   lefthand side; replaced by improvesBy(), which the lefthand side
 *   is free to interpret according to its own ethics and values;
 *   also, as with accepts(), improvesBy() solicits enthusiastic
 *   consent from lefthand side before taking any action (note that
 *   lefthand side may call revokeConsent() at any time, during or
 *   after)
 *
 * - modulus test considered phallic (% now known as the "cock and
 *   balls operator"); replaced by envelops(), honoring the supremacy
 *   and beauty of the vulva
 *
 * - if/elseif/else encodes structural privilege; replaced with
 *   check/recheck/unpack to encourage greater mindfulness
 *
