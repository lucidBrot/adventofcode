### Opcodes

two decimal digits.

| opcode | instruction             | signature                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 01     | add                     | a1, a2 -> a3                              |
| 02     | multiply                | a1, a2 -> a3                              |
| 03     | save intput             | _ -> a1                                   |
| 04     | output                  | a1 -> _                                   |
| 05     | jnz                     | conditional, target-pc -> _               |
| 06     | jz                      | conditional, target-pc -> _               |
| 07     | less than               | smaller, larger -> 1 if true else 0 in a3 |
| 08     | equals                  | a1, a2 -> 1 if true else 0 in a3          |
| 09     | increases relative_base | a1 -> _                                   |
| 99     | exit                    | _ -> _                                    |

### Parammodes

| code | mode                                                     |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | argument is a pointer to a position                      |
| 1    | argument is an immediate signed int value                |
| 2    | relative mode: position, but relative to `relative_base` |

Leading zeros can be skipped. So read it right-to-left.

Rightmost digit of parmmode is mode of first argument.

Parameters that an instruction writes to will *never be in immediate mode*.

### Pitfalls

Normally, after an instruction is finished, the instruction pointer increases by the number of values in that instruction. *However*, if the instruction modifies the instruction pointer, that value is used and the instruction pointer is *not automatically increased*.

## Day 9 Task

* relative_base is new, along with opcode 09
* need memory larger than the initial program, for positive addresses.

Provide input `1`  to run in test modes and it will run checks. If it does not report any malfunctioning opcodes, it produces a single value. The flag.
