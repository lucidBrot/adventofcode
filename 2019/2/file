HAI 1.3
  CAN HAS STDIO?

HOW IZ I DOTHING YR OPCODE AN YR BASE AN YR ARG
    VISIBLE SMOOSH "Execute function DOTHING " AN OPCODE AN " " AN BASE AN " " AN ARG MKAY
    GTFO
IF U SAY SO

  I HAS A problem ITZ A BUKKIT

  IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR INDEX
      I HAS A something
      GIMMEH something
      something IS NOW A YARN
      BOTH SAEM something AN "", O RLY?
        YA RLY
          VISIBLE "End of input"
          problem HAS A len ITZ INDEX
          GTFO
        NO WAI
      OIC
      something IS NOW A NUMBR
      problem HAS A SRS INDEX ITZ something
  IM OUTTA YR LOOP
  VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!!!1!"
  I IZ DOTHING YR 0 AN YR 1 AN YR 2 MKAY

OBTW
  BTW print contents
IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR INDEX TIL BOTH SAEM INDEX problem'Z len
         VISIBLE problem'Z SRS INDEX
   IM OUTTA YR LOOP
TLDR

KTHXBYE

OBTW
    OPCODES:
        1:  ADD
            add up next two numbers as pointers to the inputs,
            store in *num3
        2:  MULTIPLY
        99: HALT

    After operation, move forward 4 positions (opcode, input, input, output)

TLDR
