HAI 1.3
  CAN HAS STDIO?
  
  IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR ITERATOR WILE DIFFRINT ITERATOR AN -1
      I HAS A something
      GIMMEH something
      something IS NOW A YARN
      BOTH SAEM something AN "", O RLY?
        YA RLY
          VISIBLE "End of input"
          GTFO
        NO WAI
      OIC
      something IS NOW A NUMBR
  IM OUTTA YR LOOP
  VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!!!1!"
  VISIBLE something
KTHXBYE

OBTW
    OPCODES:
        1:  ADD
            add up next two numbers as pointers to the inputs,
            store in *num3
        2:  MULTIPLY
        99: HALT

    After operation, move forward 4 positions (opcode, input, input, output)

TLDR
