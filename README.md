## Advent Of Code
Not necessarily beauty incarnate, the code you'll find in this repository is wild, romantic nature untamed. It is water: sometimes a quiet stream of art, droplets of learning, an ocean of unknown green and blue to be discovered. Other times it will be hideous or hide dark creatures below the sparkling surface.

You aren't supposed to be reading this anyway. The only reason this is not on my private git server is because it is possible that I want to discuss with friends and compare our approaches.

See [https://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) if you'd like to join in the fun.

Note that I intend to use this to experiment, try new features or hacky things, or learn new languages. So most of the code will not be representative of my quality production code.
